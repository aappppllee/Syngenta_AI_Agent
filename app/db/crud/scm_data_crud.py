# Import SCM Pydantic schemas if you create them for CRUD operations
# from app.schemas.scm_data_schemas import ...

# This file is intended to hold CRUD operations for the SCM (Supply Chain Management)
# data tables (SCMCustomers, SCMProducts, etc.) IF you need to interact with them
# directly via API endpoints (e.g., for an admin interface to view/edit SCM data).

# For the current scope of the intelligent agent, the primary interaction with these
# SCM tables is through the `DatabaseInteractor` (which uses NL-to-SQL) and the
# initial data loading from the CSV (`app/data_loading/load_dataco_csv.py`).

# If you decide to build API endpoints for direct CRUD on SCM data,
# you would add functions here similar to user_crud.py or role_crud.py.

# Example placeholder function (not implemented):
async def get_scm_product_by_id(db: AsyncSession, product_id: int) -> Optional[SCMProducts]:
    """
    Placeholder: Retrieve an SCMProduct by its ID.
    """
    # result = await db.execute(select(SCMProducts).filter(SCMProducts.product_id == product_id))
    # return result.scalars().first()
    print(f"Placeholder: Would fetch SCMProduct with ID {product_id}")
    return None

async def get_recent_scm_orders(db: AsyncSession, limit: int = 10) -> PyList[SCMOrders]:
    """
    Placeholder: Retrieve recent SCMOrders.
    """
    # result = await db.execute(
    #     select(SCMOrders)
    #     .order_by(SCMOrders.order_date.desc()) # Assuming order_date is the correct column name
    #     .limit(limit)
    # )
    # return result.scalars().all()
    print(f"Placeholder: Would fetch {limit} recent SCMOrders")
    return []

# Add more specific CRUD functions as needed for your application's requirements
# for SCMCustomers, SCMCategories, SCMDepartments, SCMOrders, SCMOrderItems.
